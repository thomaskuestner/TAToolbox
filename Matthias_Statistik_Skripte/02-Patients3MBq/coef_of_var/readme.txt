Please be aware of the fact that this script was just programmed for different personal statistic aims 
and the intending was never a versatile, useable and robust usage.
My advice is to do your own statistical script and just copy some code lines from this files.

With this file you get the coeff of var from the tf-values from ROI1 and ROI2. In the thesis there is a accurate explanation.

You need the prepared .mat files:
'summarized_data_of_all_Patients_ROI1.mat'
'summarized_data_of_all_Patients_ROI2.mat'

In the first lines you can choose some settings about:
Which ROI?
Outlier included or not? (Worst 4 TF-Value-Outlier)
Do you want plots as Output?
Do you want pdf-Files as Output?
Do you want mat-Files as Output?
