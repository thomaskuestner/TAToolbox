*********!!!!*********
Please be aware of the fact that this script was just programmed for different personal statistic aims 
and the intending was never a versatile, useable and robust usage.
My advice is to do your own statistical script and just copy some code lines from this files.
*********!!!!*********

With this file you can generate LMEs of the data from ROI1 or ROI2.

You need the prepared .mat files:
'summarized_data_of_all_Patients_ROI1.mat'
'summarized_data_of_all_Patients_ROI2.mat'

In the first lines you can choose the some settings:
Which ROI?
Outlier included or not? (Worst 4 TF-Value-Outlier)
TF-Values original or logarithmed?

!!***!!
Important is you have to change the value log in the name of the files manually!
You have to go to the line and type some other name in, if you dont you dont know if you have log or original tf-Values.
!!***!!

You have to comment or decomment the last lines if you want 
plots or
.mat-files
or both
