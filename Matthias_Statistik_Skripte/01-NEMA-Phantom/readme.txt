Please be aware of the fact that these scripts were just programmed for different personal statistic aims 
and the intending was never a versatile, useable and robust usage.
My advice is to do your own statistical script and just copy some code lines from this files.

You need this files for both scripts:
'Measured_vs_Simulated_allDosis_Mask_TK.mat'

With the file Nema-Compare you get
Pearson, Spearman, paired-t-test, wilcoxon statistics but you have to do the settings (read in, which data etc.) all in the code!

With the file linearity_check_of_TFs.m you get 
Pearson, Spearman but you have to do the settings (read in, which data etc.) all in the code!
There some lines you have to comment if you want to use it with original data and some to use it for log-data
